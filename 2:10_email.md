Dear Mr. Ardmore,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to you because I recently purchased a monitor from your store and the size of the monitor is too big for my desk. When purchasing this monitor, I thought it would be fantastic for an average gamer like me, since the monitor offered high fresh rate and crystal clear display. However, I did not double-check the size of my desk and the size of this monitor. After putting the monitor on my desk, it ended up taking most of the space of my desk, making me unable to put other essential electronics.

I am wondering if I still can return this monitor, as I just received this item. Sorry for any inconvenience caused by my request. By the way, I accidentally lost my receipt and I have no idea if I still can return this product. Please help me check the policy of your store and I truly appreciate your assistance.

Dear Ms. Alderman,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing because I happened to encounter an issue when attempting to reserve a meeting room on the library's website. I received an error message from your website and it seemed that the reservation procedure could not properly proceed after the error message popped up. I really need to book a room from my book club, as this venue is crucial for our club activities. I received the error message yesterday and I am wondering if the website has already been fixed.

I tried to reset my internet and thought it was something wrong with my computer. However, after multiple attempts, the problem remained unsolved. I kept receiving error messages last night and I could not complete my reservation.

I am wondering if there is any other way to complete the reservation. I truly appreciate your help.
