In my opinion, when choosing which employees to promote, companies should primarily focus on the amount of work a certain employee has done. In other words, productivity is the sole determinator when it comes to granting promotions. The reason why employees are hired in a company is because they can benefit the company in a meaningful way. Employees who can make valuable contributions to a company should be given promotion, and establishing a proper rewarding system for productive individuals is crucial for the long-term survival of a company. Without such a meritocratic system, a company may fail to attract high achievers and innovative individuals.
However, others may think that experience matters way more than productivity. Often time, that perspective is flawed and superficial. Experience does matter in certain fields, but our world is moving rapidly and constantly reshaping. For instance, programmers have to learn new skills every two or three years, otherwise their skillset may be rendered obsolete in the current job market. In this sense, experienced programmers do not hold a competitive edge with newcomers, if those newcomers are willing to learn and experiment with new tools. Undoubtedly, some old skills can be transferred when picking up a new programming language. However, at this fast moving pace, the amount of transferrable skills are overshadowed by brand new technologies and new programming paradigms.
