Dear Prof. Choi,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing because I could not recall the name of the book you have mentioned in the previous lecture. I remember that you suggested a book for further reading in the economics class and that book could offer insights for the current economic situation in Venezuela. You proposed several theories about the downfall of Venezuelan economy and this book is relevant to the topics you discussed. 

Could you help suggest the name of the book? Your help is most valued here and sorry for any inconvenience I have caused.
Also, could you give me the title and the author of this book? Because I want to borrow it from the library, the detailed information could definitely help me secure a photocopy. I am deeply intrigued by the economic crisis in Venezuela and as you have mentioned, the current mismanagement of the Venezuelan economy is multifaceted and cannot be reduced to a single factor. Since this book offers a comprehensive overview of the Venezuelan economy, I believe tit could be extremely helpful in writing my assignment.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,


Alan
